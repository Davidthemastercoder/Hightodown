Hightodown is not a proper programming language, but only provides useful functions that are very often used in the everyday life of an IT admin, such as generating hashes to replace a password. HTD(hightodown) is named after its syntax of separating each expression with a new line. An eye has been placed on useful functions and if HTD itself is not sufficient it is also possible to execute Python code. HTD is by no means mature It is also not perfectly stable and it should be weighed up whether the use of HTD in productive environment is really necessary. At the moment a Windows Binary and 2 Linux Binaries is available for ARM and one for X86 these two may be very unstable and probably not developed by me. It may also be that not everything works exactly as with the Windows Binarie. HTD does not have if statements or loops, however, other troll structures, which are illuminated in more detail in this documentary. It may be that the anti-virus protection with the HTD interpreter raises alarms this may be because the exe is not signed. The script must be in the same directory and must always be called Test.htd (No more since you can now use the parameters you can specify if you can start the exe per Commandline also take another file). All values are specified in a new row WITHOUT SPACE OR OTHER FORMATTING. Hightodown is very case-sensitive NO INPROVISIONS. The commands can also be written with a semicolon directly behind the command. NO BLANK LINES.
